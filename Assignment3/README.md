## How to run the Code

1. Place the files main.py, gridworld.py and agents.py in the same directory and then run the following command

```
python3 main.py
```

This will create the plots (task2.png, task3.png, task4.png, task5.png) for all the tasks and save it in the same directory. Also, the terminal output shows which agent is currently working and the seed on which it is running along with the iterations it takes to reach the goal.
